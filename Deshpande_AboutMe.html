          <p>Who do I want to be known as? The amazing and creative product 
          mangager whose software apps changed the world. My plan for achieving
          my goal of becoming an amazing product manager will be maintaining
          a balanced relationship with my colleagues and using what
          I see to an advantage. A collaborative and creative mindset
          is the way to go! I have picked this field because I have used my 
          creative freeedom ever since I learned to talk. Whether it meant coming
          up with clothing designs as a child or thinking of ways a product could
          have been better or easier to use. This is something I am certain I will
          not get bored of.<br>
          
          <br>An experience I have related to the product design field is 
          the DECA Minicon which I participated in through Dublin DECA. At the 
          roleplay, we were assigned the role of a product
          manager, I decided to add that from a "previous experience", I learned
          that people are really into the color blue, so I designed a shoe which
          was blue. Just tiny things like these. Sometimes I have recieved packages
          from online and the first thing that popped into my mind is how it could
          have been more user-friendly. Maybe the packaging could have been 
          easier or finding things on labels could have been better. This mindset
          is really hard to let go and is important when it comes to designing 
          products. One thing I have realised about myself is that I am open-
          minded and a natural leader. I love to take charge of things and accept
          other people's opinions. This is what makes teamwork dreamwork. I am also
          constantly motivating others and myself no matter how difficlut the times
          get. Motivation is what keeps the work going, without motivation, people 
          wouldn't bother even coming to work. But I want to make work a friendly 
          and helpful environment for my colleagues. </br>
          
          <br>One skill that I  possess which I believe to be important is the 
          ability to communicate. No matter what job, communication is the number
          one key to success. Even if it means just conversing with your colleagues. 
          Nothing will be the way you wish for it to be one hundred percent of the 
          time. Instead of arguing with one another, calmly conversing and figuring 
          out the real problem is very important for the end product. Through experiences, 
          I have realised that communication is very important for success. When
          we worked together and kept communicating how it was going and if we 
          needed help, the job was that much easier.
          Another skill that is necessary for the role of a product manager is 
          creativity. Coming up with new ideas is not the only job of a product
          manager. Taking in the views of the audience is also important. At the
          end of the day, whatever you are doing is not for yourself, but for 
          the people. People like new, and new is not always easy. But I am ready
          for the challenge. Life is not a sweet, smooth ride, it has bumps and 
          turns, but success will only come from overcoming these obstacles and
          not from giving up. To tie it all up, I am an open-minded and motivational
          person looking forward to becoming the product manager who changed the 
          world. I have a mindset of how things could have been done differently
          or better and have the skills of communication and creativity. I thank
          you for taking the time to read this and invite you to explore the rest
          of my website. Enjoy!</br>
