          <p>Who do I want to be known as? The amazing investment banker
          whose creative mindset made a change in the world. My plan for achieving
          my goal of becoming an amazing investment banker will be maintaining a
          balanced relationship with my colleagues and using what I see as well as my number skills to an advantage.
          A collaborative and creative mindset is the way to go! I have picked this
          field because I have always enjoyed working with numbers and helping others.
          This is something I am certain I will not get bored of. As an initiative
          towards this career choice, I am planning on taking business classes
          throughout high school and continuing to be a part of Dublin DECA.<br>
          
          <br>Experiences I have related to the investment banking field are the
          DECA Minicons which I have participated in through Dublin DECA. One thing
          I have realized about myself is that I am open-minded and a natural leader.
          I love to take charge of things and accept other people's opinions. This
          is what makes teamwork dreamwork! I am also constantly motivating others
          and myself no matter how difficult the times get. Motivation is what keeps
          the work going, without motivation, people wouldn't bother even coming
          to work. But I want to make work a friendly and helpful environment for
          my colleagues.</br>
          
          <br>One skill that I possess which I believe to be important is the ability
          to communicate. No matter what job, communication is the number one key
          to success. Even if it means just conversing with your colleagues. Nothing
          will be the way you wish for it to be one hundred percent of the time.
          Instead of arguing with one another, calmly conversing and figuring out
          the real problem is very important for the end product. Through experiences,
          I have realized that communication is very important for success. When
          we worked together and kept communicating how it was going and if we 
          needed help, the job was that much easier. Another skill that is necessary
          for the role of an investment banker is creativity. At the end of the 
          day, whatever you are doing is not for yourself, but for the people. 
          Life is not a sweet, smooth ride, it has bumps and turns, but success 
          will only come from overcoming these obstacles and not from giving up.
          To tie it all up, I am an open-minded and motivational person looking 
          forward to becoming the investment banker who changed the world. I have
          a mindset of how things could have been done differently or better and
          have the skills of communication and creativity. I thank you for taking
          the time to read this and invite you to explore the rest of my website.
          Enjoy!</br>
