      <p>After hearing from my friend that her dad was running for mayor, I went
      campaigning with them to see what it was all about. For about two hours, we went around
      the neighborhood breifing to others what Mr. Goel was campaigning for. When I first read
      why he was campaigning, I one hundred percent agreed and really felt that
      he could improve Dublin. Some of Mr. Goel's ideas were to pause housing, solve
      the school crisis, and bring back business. While I was campaigning, I was able to make
      connections with the people I was communicating with. For example, with parents
      I was able to communicate what it is like having to get up early to take the
      bus and get stuck in traffic. Trust me, sitting in a bus for an hour is not 
      fun. When it came to business, I was able to talk about how I saw my dad drive through commute every day 
      for me and my brother. The only question I had for him was, don't you ever
      get bored of all this? His response, I do, but when I know I have to do it,
      what is the point in complaining. Something that anyone who travels on I580 and
      passes Dublin can relate to is the crazy housing! Whenever I see the hills,
      or should I say what used to be hills, I can only think that we need to stop!
      Everywhere I turn, there are houses, it is like some disease is spreading. Communicating
      all of these points to people who would understand me made the job a lot easier 
      and smoother. This overall experience made me more confident and knowledgable
      about what is going on around me.</p>
