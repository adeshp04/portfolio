      <p>After hearing from my friend that her dad was running for mayor, I went
      campaigning with them to see what it was all about. For 2 hours, we used the
      three main points and elaborated. While I was doing this, I was able to make
      connections with the people I was talking to. This made the job a lot easier
      and smoother. This overall experience made me more confident and improved
      my public speaking.</p>
