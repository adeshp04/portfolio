            <p>I gained interest in the violin since a young age, part of the reason
            being that my dad is a musician. I grew up seeing him play the harmonium
            and sing. When I told my dad that I wante to learn the violin, he immediately 
            enrolled me in a class and bought me a violin. For about a year, I
            learned how to play the violin, but I felt like I wasn't getting where 
            I wanted to be with it. So we switched classes and started with the technical
            aspect. It was a bit easier since I has previous experience. I have
            been playing the violin since 2016 and aim to continue.</p>
