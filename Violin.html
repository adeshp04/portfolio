            <p>I gained interest in the violin since a young age, part of the reason
            being that my dad is a musician. I grew up seeing him play the harmonium
            and sing. When I told my dad that I wanted to learn the violin, he immediately 
            enrolled me in a class and bought me a violin. For about a year, I
            learned how to play the violin, but I felt like I wasn't getting where 
            I wanted to be with it. So we switched classes and I started with the technical
            aspect. It was a bit easier to grasp on since I had previous experience,
            but this class was no longer just reading notes and playing songs. It was
            math and memory and technique and a lot more things. Because there is 
            so much content, I have to practice a lot. I am currently practicing
            for a winter recital with both a group performance and a solo. Just like my
            dad, music never bores me and it never will. Music is something I like 
            to practice in my free time. Over the years, I have learned to play
            the harmonium as well. I have been playing the violin since 2016 and
            aim to continue.</p>
