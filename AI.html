            <p>At the beginning of the school year, we were 
            given a project to improve an existing tutorial. My partner and I
            chose Mini Golf. To start off, we decided to test the game and act 
            as if we were giving feedback to the original creator. We then took 
            that feedback and used that as what we wanted to improve in the game.
            The feedback was categorized into three tiers and worked on after a 
            plan was made. The game was tested many time while it was being improved
            just liek the way it was at the very start.</p>
