            <p class="card-text">The first partner project, creating a game using
            the scratch platform. The objective of this project was to improve 
            if not develop the ability to work with another person and to get
            familiar with the Scratch program. My role in this project was to lay
            out a breif plan of what to include in the game, keeping in mind the
            restrictions of the platform. I also took account of updating the plan
            as time moved along. I learned that some things must be compromised
            for a successful end product. Sure there might be some things you 
            wished the project had and some things you didn't. But you always 
            have to look at the bright side, a least there were some ideas of yours
            that ended up being used. Partne projects will never be successful 
            until both sides are willing to cooperate. Because this project
            involved teamwork, we were able to use things that one was better at
            than the other to our advantage and get things done faster. For some days,
            my partner was absent, but I tried my best to get some work done so that
            we weren't behind to make up for it. I was able to set up the base of 
            the game which really made things easier for the time we had left.</p>
