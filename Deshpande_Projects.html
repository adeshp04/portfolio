                <p class="card=subtitle mb-2"><strong>Duration:</strong>
                Around 3 days (Early September 2018)
                <br><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles</br>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> To create a game or story and to get familiar with 
                block coding
                <br><strong>Type:</strong> Partner Project</br>
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was to create a 
            game using Scratch and become familiar with the platform. My role
            in this project was to lay out a brief plan of what to include in 
            the game, keeping in mind the restrictions of the platform. I also
            took account of updating the plan as time moved along and creating
            the opening screen. My job was to start all of the coding as well as 
            decide what things were possible along the way since my partner was
            absent the first day. This included involvment in the creative aspect
            of the project which really made me think as if I was a player.
            Partner projects will never be successful until both sides are 
            willing to cooperate. A skill I learned was how to code using blocks
            in Scratch and figuring out different ways to code because of the 
            limitations of Scratch. Through this project, I also learned how to 
            set up the base of any coding to make the job easier. Because this 
            project involved teamwork, we were able to use things that one was 
            better at than the other to our advantage and get things done faster.
            The day my partner was absent, I tried my best to 
            get some work done so that we weren't behind. As a result of
            the absence, we weren't able to reach the best of our abilities, but 
            we still finished strong. I was able to set up the opening of the game 
            which really made things easier for the time we had left.</p>
