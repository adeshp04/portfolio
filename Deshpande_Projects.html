            <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was to create a 
            game using Scratch and getting familiar with the platform. My role
            in this project was to lay out a breif plan of what to include in 
            the game, keeping in mind the restrictions of the platform. I also
            took account of updating the plan as time moved along and creating
            the opening screen. This included involvment in the creative aspect
            of the project which really made me think as if I was a player.
            Partner projects will never be successful until both sides are 
            willing to cooperate. A skill I learned was how to code using blocks
            in scratch and figuring out different ways to code because of the 
            limitation of Scratch. Through this project, I also learned how to 
            set up the base of any coding to make the job easier. Because this 
            project involved teamwork, we were able to use things that one was 
            better at than the other to our advantage and get things done faster.
            For a couple of days, my partner was absent, but I tried my best to 
            get some work done so that we weren't behind to make up for it. I was
            able to set up the base of the game which really made things easier 
            for the time we had left.</p>
