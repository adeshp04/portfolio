                Around 3 days (Early September 2018)
                <br><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles</br>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> To create a game or story and to get familiar with 
                block coding
                <br><strong>Type:</strong> Partner Project</br>
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was to create a game using Scratch and become familiar with the platform. My role in this project was to lay out a brief plan of what to include in the game, keeping in mind the restrictions of the platform. I also took account of updating the plan as time moved along and creating the opening screen. My job was to start coding as well as
decide what things were possible along the way since my partner was absent the first day. This included involvement in the creative aspect of the project which really made me think as if I was a player. Partner projects will never be successful until both sides are willing to cooperate. A skill I learned was how to code using blocks in Scratch and figuring out different ways to code because of the limitations of Scratch. Through this project, I also learned how to set up the base of any coding to make the job easier. Because this project involved teamwork, we were able to use things that one was better at than the other to our advantage and get things done faster. The day my partner was absent, I tried my best to get some work done so that we weren't behind. As a result of the absence, we weren't able to reach the best of our abilities, but we still finished strong. I was able to set up the opening of the game which really made things easier for the time we had left.</p>

                21 days (03/04 - 03/24)
                <br><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles</br>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> To learn and practice how to photo manipulate images such as add a border or a mask using Python
                <br><strong>Type:</strong> Partner Project</br>
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was to find some pictures and use what we have learned in Python to photo manipulate them. My role in this project involved fixing a lot of the errors that popped up as well as doing the documentation and presentation for the project. While my partner and I were recreating the images, we had to think as if we were the clients and code what we would have liked to receive. This meant thinking outside the box as well as using our creativity. A skill I learned was retracing my steps to find errors because most of the time the answer lied there. Since this was partner work, my partner and I were able to combine our strengths and weaknesses to get the best of each other. Because we had a lack of communication at times, it was hard to know what we wanted to finish at home and what we wanted to keep for class. We did not let this pull us down and we finished with ideas that we didn't expect we would be able to complete.</p>
