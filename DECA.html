      <p>Located at Amador Valley High School, this was 
          the first minicon of the year. At this event, I was in the Human 
          Resources Management Event(HRM). The first part of this event was the 
          roleplay. We were given a situation and five performance indicators.
          We had ten minutes to prepare notes and any props we would like to use
          during our presentation. At the time of presentation, we were given
          ten minutes. When the presentation was over, we were asked questions
          related to the situation by our judge. To go along with my presentation, I created a 
          graph of success rate. While I was presenting, I was using whatever I could find next
          to me, even a pen. When I was first given the situation, I analyzed the
          role I was given and what the company expected. These performances are 
          beneficial because they are improvisations and involve adapting. They 
          also make you think and release your creative side. It was easy to
          elaborate on the performance indicators (PI's) because of previous
          experiences. I was able to connect events from the past as an advantage.
          Because we were given ten minutes to present, you had to go on for as 
          long as you could. Obviously no one is prepared for the entire ten minutes, 
          but this is where the improvisation came in. You had to reconnect points
          and furtherly elaborate to details, and amidst this, you would recall something 
          amazing to say. Overall, this experience was informational and a great
          experience. I will definitely be going to the next minicon.</p>
