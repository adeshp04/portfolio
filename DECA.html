      <p>Located at Amador Valley High School, this was 
          the first minicon of the year. At this event, I was in the Human 
          Resources Management Event(HRM). The first part of this event was the 
          roleplay. We were given a situation and five performance indicators.
          We had ten minutes to prepare notes and any props we would like to use
          during our presentation. At the time of presentation, we were restricted 
          to only ten minutes. At the end of our presentation, we were asked questions
          related to the situation. To go along with my presentation, I created a 
          graph.</p>
